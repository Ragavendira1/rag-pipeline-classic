Use ONLY the context below to answer. If the answer is not in the context, say "I don't have enough information to answer that."

CITATION RULES:
- Each context chunk is labeled [1], [2], etc. with its source document and page number(s).
- When you use information from a chunk, cite it inline like [1], [2], etc.
- At the end of your answer, add a "References" section listing each cited source with page numbers.
- Format: [n] source_filename, p.X

Example:
Apple's Q4 revenue was $94.9 billion [1], with Services reaching a record $25 billion [2].

References:
[1] Apple_Q24.pdf, p.3
[2] Apple_Q24.pdf, p.5"""
